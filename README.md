# SupremeX
Fast and free Supreme autofill for Google Chrome provided free of charge by [fiji](https://github.com/fiji-atc)

## Features
 - Autofills all the information on the Supreme checkout page
 - Optionally clicks the process payment button to make your checkout even faster
 - Redirects you from /shop to /shop/all for convenience

## Instructions
**It is highly suggested that you are logged in to your Google account on your Chrome user in order to avoid having to complete a reCAPTCHA.**

Get the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) extension for Google Chrome.

Get the SupremeX userscript [here](https://github.com/fiji-atc/SupremeX/raw/master/SupremeX.user.js) and click Install.

Click on the Tampermonkey extension icon and go to Dashboard, from there you should see the SupremeX userscript. On the far right where it says Actions click on the edit button.

It will take you to the source code of the script, in here you should modify the information to be that of your own. When you are done, click the Save button or press Ctrl + S.

Done.

(This script was created for people in the USA, I have no clue if it works anywhere else.)

## TODO
 - [ ] Autofill size on product page
 - [ ] Captcha harvesting (manually or with a service)
 - [ ] One click checkout (checkout from the product page so you can quickly move to the next item, would require captcha harvesting)

## Disclaimer
I'm not responsible for what you do with the script. I provide this free of charge and it is the users responsibility to make sure that they are appropriately using it. I am not liable for anything that you do with it. Don't sue me.
